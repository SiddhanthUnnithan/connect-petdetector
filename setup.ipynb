The example folder flower_photos\n","should have a structure like this:\n","\n","~/flower_photos/daisy/photo1.jpg\n","~/flower_photos/daisy/photo2.jpg\n","...\n","~/flower_photos/rose/anotherphoto77.jpg\n","...\n","~/flower_photos/sunflower/somepicture.jpg\n","\n","The subfolder names are important, since they define what label is applied to\n","each image, but the filenames themselves don't matter. Once your images are\n","prepared, you can run the training with a command like this:\n","\n","\n","```bash\n","bazel build tensorflow/examples/image_retraining:retrain && \\\n","bazel-bin/tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain \\\n","    --image_dir ~/flower_photos\n","```\n","\n","Or, if you have a pip installation of tensorflow, `retrain.py` can be run\n","without bazel:\n","\n","```bash\n","python tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain.py \\\n","    --image_dir ~/flower_photos\n","```\n","\n","You can replace the image_dir argument with any folder containing subfolders of\n","images.
